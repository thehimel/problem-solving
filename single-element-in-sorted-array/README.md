# Single ELement in a Sorted Array

## Problem Statement

You're given a list of numbers where all the numbers are presented twice except one number that appears only once. Find this element that appears only one.
Solution must have a time complexity of O(log(n)) and space complexity of O(1).

## Example

- Input: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6]
- Output: 2

- Input: [1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8]
- Output: 6

## Logic

If the solution has a time complexity of O(log(n)), some sort of binary search must be applied.
